# Reflection 1

## What are the steps in the design cycle

Design
Plan
Create
Evaluation
Implementation

Critiera A: Plan, Design
Criteria B: Solution
Critieria C: Code

## What is the purpose of a success criteria? 

The success criteria gives us a goal and a clear baseline to follow given by the client and the developer itself, to not only show the requirements of the program but also give a clear understanding of what the programmer must achieve. The success crtieria is to see if we meet the requirements of the client. 

## What do you understand now about computers/computer science that you did more before?

Computer science is not only understanding how to code or what to code, but also the importance of for who and for what. Computer science taught me the importance of designing, planning, and referencing, mixing your own code with someone elses to create a more efficient and effective program. In simple terms, I learnt that computer science is to study, understand and create an algorithmic sequence a computer can logically follow. 

## What do you understand now about yourself that you did not before Umit 1?

Creating this game made me understand my own design process and point of actions. I tend to plan quickly and effectively, but when it comes to action taking, I usually take a long time to achieve. 

## What worked for you during the development of Unit 1?

My planning and design was defientely the strong point of this unit. I think I was able to create a solid plan to follow with a long list of tasks and understood the requirements of the client and had a good and solid design of what the game will turn out to be. 

## What did not work for you during the development of Unit 1?

My coding and execution was definetely the weak point of my development. I tend to always randomly write down code in hopes that it will work, creating a complete mess of a code. 

## A developer is responsible only for the accomplishment of the success criteria. Do you agree or disagree?

As a developer we should all focus on the client and meet the clients needs. The success critieria is meerely a guidance of what the client wants and so just accomplishing the success critieria will not be enough. The developer should insure satisfaction from the client and fix any vulnerablities or bugs that may occur within the program and make sure the client is happy with the final product. A developer also has to ensure reliability and the flexibility of the program following general coding practices by adding comments and variables that make sense. 

## Follow good coding practices
