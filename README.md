# Unit 1: A classic game 
![](game.gif) 

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

1. The game has to be entirely text-based.
2. The game must record the time played.
3. The game must record the player name and score.

Apart for this requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic or genre.

## Personal Problem definition: 
With the rise of the digital age and GUI based games with fancy 3D graphics and features, all retro games were lost in that process. Since I was young, I have always been a fan of retro games, playing the classic Nintendo 64 and especially a lot of text-based games. These text-based games, although sounds unengaging and boring, has a special place in my heart and I always look back at those good old days where I always struggled to read and finish the game. This nostalgia always caught up to me, and made me question if I was able to create something similar to what I grew up as, and experienced those good old days.

## Proposed Solution

### Design Statement
I will design and create a text-based game for a client who is the local game shop. The category of the game will be a prison break game and will be created in python 3.x. The game will take around 3 weeks to finish and will be evaluated according to the criteria. 


### Justification
The game will be created using python as according to statistictimes.org, it is the most common language in the world and is also the only language I am proficient at. The game will be a text-based game, without any GUI or images to keep the game as less performance and storage hungry as possible. As the only accessible system I have is based on macOS, the game will be coded on a macOS system and on a macOS based python editor called “Pycharm”. I chose Pycharm as I personally find it easy to code on and is also one of the most popular python editors in the world. 

### Details
The genre of the game is an adventure game, and the player has to escape prison through numerous choices and decisions the player has to make the best decisions. The game will consist of a prologue explaining the context of the game and have interactable characters and objects throughout. The game will have at least 3 endings or outcomes and will require at least 10 user inputs to complete game. All 3 endings will be unique and have varying difficulty levels to achieve. The game will keep track of the name and score of the user (as the client requested) and will consist of a basic saving feature to make sure the user has the best experience from playing this game. 


## Success Criteria

The goal of the game will be:
  1. The game has to be entirely text-based
  2. The game must record the time played
  3. The game must record the player name and score
  4. The user can make more than 10 decisions/inputs in the game
  5. Game must have more than 3 outcomes/endings
  6. Must consist a basic start menu

## System Diagram

Fig1.
This shows the system diagram of the game. My system will be based on MAC OS and on a system with a core i7 with 16GB of RAM and 4GB of VRAM. The game will be created on python 3.x and will get an input from keyboard and an output as a text terminal.

## First Minimum Viable Product (MVP 1)

A Minimum Viable Product is something like a first demo of the game. In this case, my first ending was my first MVP of the game and consisted of a few basic functions and a basic time and name keeping feature. A video was also made so the G12's would evalute my progress (still awaiting feedback from them). 


```.py
import sys
import time
import os
start_time = time.time()
score=0

#dp = Dramatic Print
def dp(str):
    for char in str:
        sys.stdout.write(char)
        sys.stdout.flush()

def dp1(str):
    for char in str:

    for char in str:
        sys.stdout.write(char)
        sys.stdout.flush()

    for char in str:
        sys.stdout.write(char)
